    <div class="main"> Mental Health in Teens</div>
  <div id=p1>
      <p>49.5% of adolescents have struggled with a mental disorder and it’s only getting worse. Suicide is now the 2nd leading cause of death in youth. Let’s advocate for people to treat mental illnesses like any other illness and for school systems to teach about mental health and coping mechanisms early on so that we can prevent these illnesses from developing or at least reduce the severity of theses disorders instead of waiting for them to go through these battles.</p>

    <div class="sub">What is a mental health disorder?

    <div class="p2">Mental health disorders are any conditions that alter the way someone thinks, their behavior,  or mood. Just to list a few, some of these include: depression, anxiety, eating disorders, schizophrenia, addictive behaviors and so much more.

    <div class="sub2">Why should I care?
    <div class="p3">You should care because mental illnesses are REAL and effect so many teens but only 1 in 5 teens will get the help they need. Schools aren't teaching about mental health and sucide prevention until 10th grade when statistically suicide and mental illnesses are at their peak in high school years. This is unacceptably; we need to introduce these topics way early on so that when students start to go through this they are much better at coping with their illneses.
